#   **Python Strings**

##    String

    Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
    'hello' is the same as "hello".
    You can display a string literal with the print() function:
    
![hello](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79274212/212899981-78a2e0f5-cad3-4c0c-a836-731d47eebacc.PNG)
